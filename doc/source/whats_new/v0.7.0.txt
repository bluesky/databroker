v0.7.0 (2016-12-21)
-------------------

Enhancements
++++++++++++

* Add convenience method for exporting from one Broker instance into another.
* Experimental: support regex-based field selection in Broker methods.

Bug Fixes
+++++++++

* Fix handling of timezones. To summarize: all times are *stored* as a float
  number that is a UNIX timestamp (number of seconds since 1970 in Greenwich).
  The ``get_events`` method simply returns this raw number. The ``get_table``
  method provides the option (on by default) to convert these float numbers to
  datetime objects, which can be more convenient in some circumstances. There
  are two flags for controlling this feature: ``convert_times`` and
  ``localize_times``. By default, ``convert_times=True`` and
  ``localize_times=True``. This returns pandas datetime64 objects that are
  "naive" (meaning they don't have a timezone attached) and are in the local
  time. This tells you the wall clock time when the experiment was performed in
  timezone configured in ``db.mds.config['timezone']``. If
  ``localize_times=False``, the datetime objects are again "naive" but in UTC
  time. This tells you the wall clock time of a clock in Greenwich when the
  experiment was performed.
